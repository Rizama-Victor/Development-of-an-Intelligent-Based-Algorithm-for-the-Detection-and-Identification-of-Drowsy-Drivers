## 🔍 Overview

Drowsiness remains a major cause of road accidents as many drivers fail to recognize fatigue early during long journeys. Although it may only last a few minutes, its potential consequences can be disastrous which includes the impairment of attention and alertness levels. This project focuses on the development of an Intelligent Driver Drowsiness Detection model that leverages computer vision and deep learning to monitor facial cues such as eye closure and yawning in real time. The system aims to accurately detect early signs of drowsiness which would be useful for alerting the driver before loss of control occurs, and ensuring safe driving under varying environmental conditions.

## 🧩 Research Objectives

- To curate a high-quality dataset of drowsy and none drowsy drivers.
- To train and develop an intelligent driver drowsiness detection model that is capable to detecting several drowsiness cues.
- To evaluate and assess the performance of the developed model in accurately detecting drowsy drivers in real-time.
